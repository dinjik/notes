This is a personal collection of quick notes on networking, cybersecurity, and CTFs. It’s a place to keep things organized and accessible for future reference. Keep in mind, I always try my best to improve these notes with better formatting and clearer explanations.

This site is mainly for my own use, but if you find something useful, feel free to use it. 


If you have a question or something to share, feel free to reach out on Discord: **dinjik**
