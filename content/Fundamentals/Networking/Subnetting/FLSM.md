FLSM (Fixed Length Subnet Mask) is a subnetting technique used in IP networking where the same subnet mask is applied uniformly across all subnets within a given network. This method contrasts with Variable Length Subnet Mask (VLSM), where different subnets within the same network can have different subnet masks. FLSM simplifies network planning and management by ensuring consistency in subnet sizes.

### **How FLSM Works**

In an FLSM, the entire address space is divided into subnets of the same size. The subnet mask remains constant for all subnets, which means every subnet will have the same number of usable IP addresses. The primary goal of FLSM is to ensure that all subnets are of equal size, making it easier to allocate and manage IP addresses.

To implement FLSM, a network administrator chooses a subnet mask that satisfies the requirements for the entire network. This subnet mask is then applied uniformly to all subnets within the network, and each subnet will have the same number of IP addresses.

### **Steps to Implement FLSM**

1. **Identify the Network**: The network address is identified based on the IP address and the number of required subnets.

2. **Choose the Subnet Mask**: Based on the number of required subnets, a suitable subnet mask is chosen that will provide enough subnet bits while keeping the subnet sizes consistent.

3. **Divide the Address Space**: The network address space is then divided into the required number of subnets, and the same subnet mask is applied to each subnet.

4. **Assign Addresses**: The addresses in each subnet are assigned sequentially, ensuring that all subnets have the same number of usable addresses.

### **Example of FLSM Implementation**

Consider a scenario where a network administrator has a network with the IP address 192.168.1.0/24 and needs to create four subnets. To implement FLSM:

1. **Choose a Subnet Mask**: The administrator decides to divide the network into four subnets. Since the original network is a /24 network (255.255.255.0), a subnet mask of /26 (255.255.255.192) is selected. This gives 64 addresses per subnet (including network and broadcast addresses).

2. **Divide the Address Space**: The address space 192.168.1.0/24 is divided into four equal subnets using the /26 mask. The subnets will be:
    
    - 192.168.1.0/26 (usable IP range: 192.168.1.1 - 192.168.1.62)
        
    - 192.168.1.64/26 (usable IP range: 192.168.1.65 - 192.168.1.126)
        
    - 192.168.1.128/26 (usable IP range: 192.168.1.129 - 192.168.1.190)
        
    - 192.168.1.192/26 (usable IP range: 192.168.1.193 - 192.168.1.254)
        
3. **Assign Addresses**: The administrator assigns devices in the network to these subnets as needed, ensuring that the IP addresses fit within the specified ranges.
