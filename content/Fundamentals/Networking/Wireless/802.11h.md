IEEE 802.11h is an extension to the IEEE 802.11 wireless networking standard, specifically designed to enhance the performance and compliance of wireless local area networks (WLANs) in Europe. The primary purpose of 802.11h is to address regulatory requirements and improve the operation of Wi-Fi devices, particularly in regions where regulations on radio frequency (RF) usage are stringent, such as the European Union. The key features of 802.11h focus on power control, spectrum management, and dynamic frequency selection (DFS), which help in ensuring that WLANs can coexist with other devices operating in the same spectrum.

### Key Features of 802.11h

1. **Dynamic Frequency Selection (DFS)**: DFS is a mechanism designed to enable Wi-Fi devices to detect and avoid interference with radar systems operating in the 5 GHz band. In regions where radar systems operate in the same frequency range as WLANs, 802.11h mandates that wireless devices must be able to detect radar signals and switch to another channel if interference is detected. This helps prevent interference with critical systems, such as weather radar or military radar.

2. **Transmit Power Control (TPC)**: TPC is a mechanism to regulate the transmit power of wireless devices. By reducing transmit power, devices can minimize interference with other systems and improve energy efficiency. In addition to improving overall spectrum efficiency, TPC helps meet regulatory requirements by ensuring that devices do not transmit at power levels that exceed local regulatory limits.

3. **Extended Channel Availability**: 802.11h provides additional channels for wireless communication, particularly in the 5 GHz frequency band. By enabling the use of additional channels, 802.11h increases the overall capacity and performance of WLANs. It also ensures that these channels can be dynamically adjusted to avoid interference from other devices using the same spectrum.

4. **Enhanced Interference Avoidance**: The combination of DFS and TPC improves the ability of Wi-Fi devices to avoid interference. By detecting radar signals and adjusting power levels accordingly, devices can minimize the chances of interference with critical systems that rely on wireless communication.

5. **Compliance with European Regulations**: 802.11h was specifically developed to help Wi-Fi devices comply with European regulations for the 5 GHz band. These regulations include rules that mandate the use of DFS and TPC to ensure that Wi-Fi devices do not interfere with other systems, such as radar systems, that operate in the same frequency range.

### Benefits of 802.11h

- **Increased Spectrum Efficiency**: By utilizing dynamic frequency selection and power control, 802.11h allows Wi-Fi devices to use available spectrum more efficiently, which leads to better performance, especially in environments with dense device deployment.

- **Regulatory Compliance**: 802.11h ensures that Wi-Fi devices meet the regulatory requirements for operating in the 5 GHz band, particularly in Europe. This allows for the continued use of Wi-Fi in these regions without causing interference with radar systems or other critical services.

- **Improved Coexistence**: Through the use of DFS and power control, 802.11h improves the coexistence of Wi-Fi devices with other RF systems, reducing the risk of interference and ensuring more reliable wireless communication.

- **Better Performance in Crowded Networks**: By managing frequency selection and power levels, 802.11h helps WLANs operate more effectively in crowded environments, such as airports or stadiums, where many devices are competing for limited spectrum.
