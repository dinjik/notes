A spatial stream refers to an independent data stream that is transmitted or received by a different antenna in a MIMO-enabled system. The more spatial streams available, the higher the potential data throughput and overall performance of the network. Each stream works by sending distinct parts of the data over separate paths, leveraging the available bandwidth more effectively.

In MIMO, these streams are transmitted simultaneously over different antennas, allowing for improved efficiency. This is particularly beneficial in high-density or challenging environments where multiple devices are connected to the same network. Spatial streams also rely on technologies like beamforming and spatial multiplexing to further optimize signal transmission.

### Technology Involved with Spatial Streams

- **MIMO Technology**: The backbone of spatial streams is MIMO, which uses multiple antennas to create independent paths for data. This enables a more efficient use of the wireless spectrum, leading to better performance.

- **Beamforming**: This technology directs the signal toward specific devices, improving the signal quality and ensuring that spatial streams are transmitted more effectively. Beamforming works in tandem with spatial streams to provide better coverage and stronger signals.

- **Spatial Multiplexing**: This method divides the data into multiple streams and sends each stream over a different antenna, thus improving the total data rate without needing additional bandwidth.
