SSTP (Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol) is a VPN protocol developed by Microsoft that provides secure remote access by encapsulating PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol) traffic within SSL/TLS. It is designed primarily for Windows environments and offers strong security while being easy to use behind firewalls and network restrictions.

#### **How SSTP Works**

SSTP operates over TCP port 443, the same port used for HTTPS traffic. This makes it highly effective at bypassing firewalls and network restrictions, as most organizations do not block HTTPS traffic. The protocol establishes a secure connection using SSL/TLS, ensuring encryption, authentication, and integrity for transmitted data.

Authentication in SSTP is typically handled through standard PPP authentication methods, including MS-CHAPv2, EAP-TLS, and PAP. Encryption relies on SSL/TLS, with support for modern cryptographic algorithms such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).

#### **Advantages of SSTP**

- **Strong Security:** Uses SSL/TLS encryption with robust authentication mechanisms to ensure secure data transmission.

- **Firewall Bypass Capability:** Operates over TCP 443, making it difficult for firewalls to block SSTP connections.

- **Seamless Integration with Windows:** Built into Windows operating systems since Windows Vista, requiring minimal setup for users in Microsoft environments.

- **Reliable Performance:** Provides stable connectivity even in restrictive network conditions due to its HTTPS-based tunneling.

#### **Use Cases for SSTP**

- Secure remote access for Windows users in corporate environments where other VPN protocols are blocked.

- Bypassing firewalls and network restrictions while maintaining encrypted communication.

- Providing an alternative to IPsec or PPTP in Microsoft-centric networks.
