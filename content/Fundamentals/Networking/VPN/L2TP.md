L2TP is a tunneling protocol used to support Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and facilitate secure communication over public or private networks. It does not provide encryption or confidentiality on its own and is often paired with IPsec for security.

### **Core Functions of L2TP**

- Encapsulates Layer 2 frames (such as PPP) for transmission over IP networks.
- Enables the creation of VPNs by forming secure tunnels between endpoints.
- Supports both remote access and site-to-site VPN configurations.

### **L2TP Encapsulation**

- Encapsulates PPP frames within L2TP headers and then wraps them in UDP.
- Uses UDP port **1701** for communication.
- Lacks built-in encryption, requiring additional security layers like IPsec.

### **How L2TP Works**

1. **Tunnel Establishment**: L2TP sets up a tunnel between LAC and LNS.

2. **Session Establishment**: Data transfer begins once authentication and configuration are completed.

3. **Data Transmission**: L2TP encapsulates PPP frames and transmits them over the tunnel.

4. **Tunnel Termination**: The connection is closed when communication ends.
