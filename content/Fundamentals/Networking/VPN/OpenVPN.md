OpenVPN is an open-source VPN protocol that provides secure and encrypted communication over public and private networks. It is widely used for remote access, site-to-site VPNs, and bypassing geo-restrictions. Unlike traditional VPN protocols, OpenVPN offers flexibility in encryption, authentication, and transport mechanisms.

### **Core Features of OpenVPN**

- Uses SSL/TLS for secure key exchange and authentication.

- Supports both UDP and TCP transport protocols for flexibility in performance and reliability.

- Allows strong encryption through OpenSSL with algorithms like AES-256, ChaCha20, and RSA.

- Supports authentication mechanisms such as username/password, certificates, and two-factor authentication.

- Works effectively behind firewalls and NAT by using port **1194 (UDP)** by default but can be configured on other ports.

- Can establish site-to-site or remote access VPN connections with high security.

### **How OpenVPN Works**

1. **Client-Server Model**: The client initiates a secure connection to an OpenVPN server.

2. **Encryption and Authentication**: SSL/TLS authenticates both parties and negotiates encryption keys.

3. **Tunnel Establishment**: An encrypted tunnel is created for secure communication between the client and the private network.

4. **Data Transmission**: Encrypted packets are sent between client and server over UDP or TCP.

5. **Session Termination**: The connection ends when the client logs out or the session times out.
