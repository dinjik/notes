RIPv2 (Routing Information Protocol Version 2) is a distance-vector routing protocol used in small to medium-sized networks. It is an enhancement of RIPv1, introducing key improvements like support for classless routing, authentication, and multicast updates. Despite its simplicity, RIPv2 is generally used in smaller networks due to its limitations, particularly the maximum hop count of 15, which restricts scalability.

#### **How RIPv2 Works**

RIPv2 operates by using hop count as a metric to determine the best path to a destination. Each router running RIPv2 periodically shares its routing table with its neighbors every 30 seconds through multicast updates. These updates help routers learn new routes and update their tables dynamically.

To prevent routing loops, RIPv2 employs mechanisms such as split horizon, route poisoning, and hold-down timers. These techniques ensure that incorrect or outdated routing information does not propagate throughout the network.

#### **Key Features of RIPv2**

- **Classless Routing (CIDR Support):** Unlike RIPv1, RIPv2 includes subnet mask information in its routing updates, allowing it to support Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM) and Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR).

- **Multicast Updates:** Uses the multicast address 224.0.0.9 to send routing updates, reducing unnecessary traffic compared to RIPv1, which used broadcast (255.255.255.255).

- **Authentication Support:** Allows routers to authenticate routing updates using either plain text or MD5 authentication, adding a layer of security.

- **Hop Count Metric:** Uses hop count as a measure of distance, with a maximum limit of 15 hops. A hop count of 16 is considered unreachable.

- **Loop Prevention Mechanisms:** Implements split horizon, route poisoning, and hold-down timers to prevent routing loops and stabilize the network.

- **Administrative Distance (AD):** Has a default administrative distance of 120, making it less preferred compared to other dynamic routing protocols like OSPF and EIGRP.

#### **Limitations of RIPv2**

- **Scalability Issues:** Due to the 15-hop limit, RIPv2 is not suitable for large networks.

- **Convergence Time:** Takes longer to converge compared to link-state routing protocols like OSPF.

- **Inefficiency in Large Networks:** Uses periodic updates every 30 seconds, even if no changes occur, leading to unnecessary bandwidth usage.

#### **Practical Applications**

Despite its limitations, RIPv2 is useful in small networks, lab environments, and legacy systems where simplicity and ease of configuration are prioritized over advanced features. It is also used in educational settings to teach basic routing concepts.
