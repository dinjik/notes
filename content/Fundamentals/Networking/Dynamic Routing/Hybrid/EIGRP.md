Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) is an advanced distance-vector routing protocol developed by Cisco. It is often classified as a hybrid protocol because it incorporates features from both distance-vector and link-state protocols. EIGRP is designed for efficiency, fast convergence, and scalability, making it suitable for large and complex networks.

Unlike traditional distance-vector protocols, EIGRP does not rely on periodic full-table updates. Instead, it uses incremental updates and only sends changes when necessary, reducing bandwidth consumption. It also introduces sophisticated metric calculations based on multiple factors, ensuring more optimal path selection.

## **Key Characteristics**

- **Uses the Diffusing Update Algorithm (DUAL)**: Ensures fast convergence and loop-free routing by precomputing backup routes.

- **Supports Multiple Metrics**: Unlike RIP, which uses hop count, EIGRP considers bandwidth, delay, reliability, and load to determine the best route.

- **Classless Routing Protocol**: Supports Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM) and Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR), allowing efficient IP address utilization.

- **Uses Reliable Transport Protocol (RTP)**: Ensures efficient and reliable exchange of routing information between EIGRP-enabled routers.

- **Multicast and Unicast Updates**: Instead of broadcasting, EIGRP sends updates using the multicast address **224.0.0.10**, reducing unnecessary traffic.

- **Neighbor Discovery and Maintenance**: Uses Hello packets to establish and maintain neighbor relationships, ensuring routers have up-to-date network information.

- **Supports Load Balancing**: Can perform both equal-cost and unequal-cost load balancing using the variance feature, distributing traffic more efficiently across multiple paths.

- **Scalability**: Suitable for large enterprise networks due to its hierarchical design, reduced bandwidth usage, and fast convergence mechanisms.

## **Metric Calculation in EIGRP**

EIGRP calculates the best path using a composite metric based on five values, though only bandwidth and delay are used by default:

- **Bandwidth**: The slowest link in the path, measured in kilobits per second (kbps).
- **Delay**: The cumulative delay along the path, measured in microseconds.
- **Reliability**: A dynamically calculated value based on the error rate of the link.
- **Load**: The amount of traffic currently being handled by the link.
- **MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit)**: Not directly used in metric calculations but is included in routing updates.

## **EIGRP Tables**

EIGRP maintains three key tables for efficient routing decisions:

- **Neighbor Table**: Stores information about directly connected EIGRP routers.
- **Topology Table**: Contains all learned routes and feasible successors (backup routes).
- **Routing Table**: Holds the best routes selected from the topology table and used for packet forwarding.

## **Loop Prevention Mechanisms**

- **Feasible Successor**: A backup route stored in the topology table, allowing fast switchover if the primary route fails.
- **Feasibility Condition**: Ensures a backup route is only used if it has a lower reported distance than the current best route, preventing loops.
- **DUAL Algorithm**: Detects and removes routing loops dynamically while ensuring quick network convergence.

## **Advantages**

- Fast convergence compared to traditional distance-vector protocols.
- Efficient bandwidth usage with incremental and multicast updates.
- Scalable due to hierarchical design and advanced metric calculations.
- Supports both IPv4 and IPv6, providing flexibility for modern networks.
- Allows for unequal-cost load balancing, optimizing network traffic distribution.

## **Limitations**

- Cisco proprietary (until 2013), limiting interoperability with non-Cisco devices.
- More complex to configure and troubleshoot than simpler protocols like RIP.
- Requires additional memory and CPU resources due to advanced calculations.
- Manual tuning may be needed for optimal performance in large-scale deployments.
