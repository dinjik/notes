**SMTP** is a protocol used for sending and relaying email between servers and clients. It is the standard protocol used for email transmission across the internet, enabling the sending of emails from the sender's email client to the recipient's mail server. SMTP is used exclusively for the sending, or "pushing," of emails and does not handle email retrieval. Retrieval protocols like **POP3** or **IMAP** are used to download and access the email messages once they have been sent.

SMTP is a text-based protocol that is used to direct the delivery of email messages. It operates on a client-server model, where the client sends the email to the server, which then routes it to the destination mail server. SMTP uses a set of commands and replies to facilitate communication between email clients and mail servers.

### **How SMTP Works**

The process of sending an email using SMTP involves several steps:

1. **User Composition**: The sender creates the email and sends it using an email client (e.g., Microsoft Outlook, Gmail).

2. **Email Submission**: The email client sends the composed message to an SMTP server. This is usually the sender's mail server, identified by the server's domain (e.g., smtp.gmail.com).

3. **Server Communication**: The SMTP server breaks down the message and identifies the destination address (recipient's email domain).

4. **Routing**: If the recipient's email server is different from the sender's, the message is routed through intermediate SMTP servers using DNS (Domain Name System) to resolve the recipient's mail server address.

5. **Delivery**: Once the message reaches the recipient's mail server, it is stored in their mailbox. From there, the recipient can retrieve the message via POP3 or IMAP.

SMTP works by sending email messages in a **store-and-forward** manner, where emails are sent to a central server, which then routes the message to the final destination. The server may queue the email if the recipient's server is temporarily unavailable, attempting delivery later.

### **SMTP Commands**

SMTP operates by sending specific commands between the client and the server to ensure the email is sent properly. Some key commands used in SMTP include:

- **HELO/EHLO**: The greeting command sent by the client to the server to initiate communication.
- **MAIL FROM**: Specifies the senderâ€™s email address.
- **RCPT TO**: Specifies the recipient's email address.
- **DATA**: Indicates the beginning of the email body, followed by the content of the email, which includes headers and the message body.
- **QUIT**: Ends the SMTP session.
- **VRFY**: Verifies if a specific email address exists.
- **RSET**: Resets the session, clearing any information entered so far.

### **SMTP Ports**

SMTP operates on several ports, primarily:

- **Port 25**: The default port for SMTP communication. However, it is often blocked by internet service providers due to its association with spam and abuse.

- **Port 587**: The preferred port for sending email securely using **SMTP with STARTTLS** encryption.

- **Port 465**: Used for secure SMTP with SSL/TLS (although port 587 is more commonly recommended).

### **Advantages of SMTP**

- **Simple and Efficient**: SMTP is a simple, text-based protocol designed to efficiently transmit email across networks.

- **Wide Adoption**: As the standard email transmission protocol, SMTP is supported by nearly all email servers and clients.

- **Extensibility**: SMTP can be extended with features like **STARTTLS** for encryption, making it versatile for modern email security needs.

### **Disadvantages of SMTP**

- **No Built-in Security**: SMTP itself does not provide any built-in encryption, which leaves email content vulnerable to interception unless additional security measures (such as STARTTLS or SMTPS) are implemented.

- **Only for Sending**: SMTP is designed solely for sending emails. It does not handle the retrieval or management of received emails, which is handled by other protocols like POP3 and IMAP.

- **Potential for Abuse**: SMTP can be abused for spam and spoofing. Email servers need to implement authentication methods (such as SPF, DKIM, and DMARC) to mitigate this risk.
