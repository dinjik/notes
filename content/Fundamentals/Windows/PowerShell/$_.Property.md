In PowerShell, `$_` is a special variable, often referred to as the **current object** or **pipeline variable**. It represents the object that is currently being processed in the pipeline. The `$_` variable is used in cmdlets or scripts to reference the current object when performing operations or accessing its properties.

`$_` is especially useful in cmdlets where you need to perform actions on each object in a collection, such as when using `ForEach-Object`, `Where-Object`, or `Select-Object`. When combined with `.Property`, it allows you to access specific properties of the current object.

## How `$_` Works with `.Property`

The notation `$_` is commonly used in the pipeline to represent the current object, and the `.Property` allows you to access one of its properties. You would use `$_` in conjunction with the dot operator to reference the properties or methods of the object as it passes through the pipeline.

For example, when working with an array of objects that each have properties, you can use `$_` to refer to each object in turn, and then use `.Property` to access or manipulate the desired property.

### Example:

```powershell
Get-Process | ForEach-Object { $_.Name }
```

In this example:

- `Get-Process` retrieves a list of processes running on the system.
- `ForEach-Object` iterates over each process.
- `$_` represents the current process object in each iteration, and `.Name` accesses the name of the process.

## Practical Usage of `$_` and `.Property`

### 1. **Filtering Objects with `Where-Object`**

You can use `$_` to filter objects based on their properties. The `Where-Object` cmdlet filters items from the pipeline that meet specific conditions.

Example:

```powershell
Get-Process | Where-Object { $_.CPU -gt 100 }
```

This command:

- Uses `Get-Process` to retrieve a list of processes.
- The `Where-Object` cmdlet filters the processes where the `CPU` property is greater than 100.

### 2. **Accessing Specific Properties in Collections**

When working with collections, you may want to select or output specific properties of each item in the collection.

Example:

```powershell
Get-Service | ForEach-Object { $_.DisplayName }
```

This command:

- Retrieves a list of services using `Get-Service`.
- Iterates through each service with `ForEach-Object`.
- Outputs only the `DisplayName` property of each service.

### 3. **Modifying Properties in Objects**

You can use `$_` to access and modify properties of objects as they pass through the pipeline.

Example:

```powershell
Get-Process | ForEach-Object { $_.PriorityClass = 'High' }
```

This command:

- Retrieves a list of processes.
- Iterates over each process with `ForEach-Object`.
- Changes the `PriorityClass` property of each process to "High".

### 4. **Using `.Property` to Access Nested Properties**

Some objects have nested properties or collections of properties. You can use `$_` to access these nested properties.

Example:

```powershell
Get-ADUser -Filter * | ForEach-Object { $_.Address.Country }
```

In this example:

- Retrieves all Active Directory users using `Get-ADUser`.
- Iterates over each user and accesses the nested `Country` property inside the `Address` property.

## Common Cmdlets Using `$_` and `.Property`

### 1. **`Select-Object`**: Select specific properties of objects.

```powershell
Get-Process | Select-Object Name, CPU
```

### 2. **`Where-Object`**: Filter objects based on a condition.

```powershell
Get-Process | Where-Object { $_.Id -eq 1234 }
```

### 3. **`ForEach-Object`**: Perform actions on each object in the pipeline.

```powershell
Get-Service | ForEach-Object { $_.Status }
```

### 4. **`Sort-Object`**: Sort objects based on specific properties.

```powershell
Get-Process | Sort-Object {$_.CPU}
```
