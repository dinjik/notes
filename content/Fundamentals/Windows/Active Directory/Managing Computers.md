In an Active Directory (AD) environment, when devices join a domain, they are typically placed in a default container called "Computers," with the exception of Domain Controllers (DCs). This is where new devices appear by default when they are added to the domain. However, it is generally not ideal to leave all devices in this container, as it may not provide the necessary organizational structure for applying different policies to different types of devices, such as workstations, servers, and domain controllers.

## Default Placement in the "Computers" Container

By default, when machines are added to the domain, they are placed in the **Computers** container. If you inspect the Domain Controller (DC), you'll see several devices already present in this container. However, as environments grow, it becomes important to create a more structured approach to managing these devices, especially when different types of devices need distinct Group Policy Objects (GPOs) applied to them.

## Workstations

Workstations are the most common devices within an Active Directory domain. These are typically the devices that users log into for everyday tasks, such as accessing applications, browsing the internet, or performing routine office work. Workstations are not intended for privileged users and should not be used by administrators for administrative tasks. Keeping workstations separate from other types of devices helps ensure that appropriate security policies, such as restrictions on administrative rights, are applied.

- Workstations should be part of specific organizational units (OUs) to apply user-specific GPOs, like login restrictions, desktop configurations, or software installations.
    
- Security policies can vary greatly between workstations and more sensitive devices, so having separate organizational containers or OUs helps manage these policies effectively.
    

## Servers

Servers, the second most common devices in an AD domain, are typically used to provide services such as file sharing, email, database management, or hosting applications. Servers are more sensitive than workstations because they provide critical services and store valuable data for the entire network. Servers are also often accessed by multiple users or machines and require strict security measures to protect them from unauthorized access or malicious attacks.

- Servers need to be placed in separate OUs to apply different policies from those applied to workstations, such as stricter security settings, software configurations, and service access restrictions.
    
- Group policies for servers typically focus on system configuration, updates, access controls, and security auditing.
    

## Domain Controllers

Domain Controllers (DCs) are the most critical devices in any Active Directory environment. They are responsible for managing and authenticating all users, computers, and other objects within the domain. They store the domain's security information, including hashed passwords for all users and computers. Due to the highly sensitive nature of domain controllers, they require the strictest security measures to prevent unauthorized access.

- Domain controllers should be placed in their own OU to ensure they are isolated from other machines and receive the appropriate security policies.
    
- Since DCs hold sensitive data and control access to the domain, they are often considered the most sensitive devices on the network and require additional security layers, such as restricted administrative access, additional auditing, and stricter Group Policy enforcement.
