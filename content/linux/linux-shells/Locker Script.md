A user has a locker in a bank. To secure the locker, we have to have a script in place that verifies the user before opening it. When executed, the script should ask the user for their name, company name, and PIN. If the user enters the following details, they should be allowed to enter, or else they should be denied access.

- Username: John
- Company name: Tryhackme
- PIN: 7385

        echo "Authentication Successful. You can now access your locker, John."
