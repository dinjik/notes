## Shebang
Every script should start from shebang. Shebang is a combination of some characters that are added at the beginning of a script, starting with `#!` followed by the name of the interpreter to use while executing the script.

```shell-session
#!/bin/bash
```
## Variables
A variable stores a value inside it. Suppose you need to use some complex values, like a URL, a file path, etc., several times in your script. Instead of memorizing and writing them repeatedly, you can store them in a variable and use the variable name wherever you need it.

```shell
# Defining the Interpreter 
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hey, whatâ€™s your name?"
read name
echo "Welcome, $name"
```
## Loops
Loop, as the name suggests, is something that is repeating. For example, you have a list of many friends, and you want to send them the same message. Instead of sending them individually, you can make a loop in your script, give your friend list to the loop and the message, and it will send that message to all your friends.

```shell
# Defining the Interpreter 
#!/bin/bash
for i in {1..10};
do
echo $i
done
```
## Conditional Statements
Conditional statements are an essential part of scripting. They help you execute a specific code only when a condition is satisfied; otherwise, you can execute another code.

```shell
# Defining the Interpreter 
#!/bin/bash
echo "Please enter your name first:"
read name
if [ "$name" = "Stewart" ]; then
        echo "Welcome Stewart! Here is the secret: THM_Script"
else
        echo "Sorry! You are not authorized to access the secret."
fi
```
