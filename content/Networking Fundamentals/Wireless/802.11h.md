**802.11h** is an extension of the **IEEE 802.11** standard that operates in the **5 GHz** frequency band for **wireless local area networks (WLANs)**. It was introduced to help address concerns about **radio frequency (RF) interference** and **spectral management** in wireless networks, particularly in Europe where the 5 GHz band is used by various wireless services.

### **Key Features of 802.11h**

802.11h introduces two important features: **Dynamic Frequency Selection (DFS)** and **Transmit Power Control (TPC)**. DFS allows wireless devices to detect radar signals in the 5 GHz band and automatically switch to a different channel to avoid interference. TPC adjusts the power output of devices to reduce interference and optimize signal strength. These features not only improve the performance of wireless networks but also ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, especially in regions with shared spectrum usage.
