A spatial stream refers to a unique, independent data stream that is transmitted or received using Multiple Input, Multiple Output (MIMO) technology. It increases the total data rate by transmitting separate data streams over multiple antennas simultaneously, even on the same channel or frequency.

Sometimes a client might use multiple streams to send and receive. But often times, a phone, for example, will use a single stream because of power saving etc.

**MIMO (Multiple Input, Multiple Output)** allows a single client to send and receive data using multiple streams simultaneously.

**MU-MIMO (Multi-User MIMO)** extends MIMO by allowing the AP to divide its antennas and streams among multiple clients simultaneously.
