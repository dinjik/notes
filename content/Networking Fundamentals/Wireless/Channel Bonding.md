Channel bonding is a technique used in Wi-Fi networks to combine multiple adjacent frequency channels into a single, wider channel. This effectively increases the bandwidth available for data transmission, leading to higher data rates.

In the diagram below, 802.11ac and 802.11n use MIMO, whereas the others use MU-MIMO.

For example, instead of using a single 20 MHz channel, channel bonding can combine two 20 MHz channels into a 40 MHz channel, or even four 20 MHz channels into an 80 MHz channel.

**Here's how it works:**

1. Multiple Channels: The Wi-Fi router and the device both have the ability to transmit and receive data on multiple channels simultaneously.
2. Combination: The router and the device can combine these channels to form a wider, higher-bandwidth channel.
3. Increased Data Rate: The wider channel allows for more data to be transmitted per unit of time, resulting in higher data rates.

Both the device and the router need to support channel bonding to utilize its benefits. If either the device or the router lacks the necessary hardware and software capabilities, channel bonding won't be possible.
