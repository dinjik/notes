## Omnidirectional Antennas

Omnidirectional antennas radiate signals equally in all directions in a 360Â° horizontal plane. They are ideal for covering wide areas but generally have lower gain compared to directional antennas.

### Examples

**Dipole Antenna:**

- One of the most common types.
- Shaped like two rods extending outward from a central point.
- Used in Wi-Fi routers, FM radio transmissions, and other general-purpose applications.

**Whip Antenna:**

- A flexible or rigid rod, often used in car radios and walkie-talkies.

**Ground Plane Antenna:**

- Designed with a vertical element and ground radials.
- Common in VHF/UHF communications like CB radios.

**Rubber Duck Antenna:**

- A short, flexible antenna used in handheld devices like walkie-talkies and portable radios.
## Directional Antennas

Directional antennas focus the signal in a specific direction, which increases range and gain but limits coverage to a narrow beam.

### Examples:

**Yagi Antenna:**

- A popular directional antenna with a central rod (boom) and multiple elements (directors and reflectors).
- Used in TV antennas and ham radio applications.

**Parabolic/Dish Antenna:**

- Uses a parabolic reflector to focus signals into a narrow beam.
- Common in satellite communication and long-distance wireless links.

**Panel Antenna:**

- Flat, rectangular antenna that emits a narrow beam.
- Often used in cellular towers and point-to-point communication.

## Semi-Directional Antennas

Semi-directional antennas strike a balance between omnidirectional and highly directional antennas. They focus the signal in a broad but not narrow beam, providing extended range and better gain than omnidirectional antennas while covering a wider area than fully directional antennas.

### Examples:

**Patch Antenna:**

- A type of microstrip antenna with a relatively broad directional beam.
- Used in compact devices like GPS systems and RFID readers.
