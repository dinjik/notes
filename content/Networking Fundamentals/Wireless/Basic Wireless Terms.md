## Cycle

A cycle in a wave refers to one complete movement of the wave, where it starts at its baseline, moves to its peak, drops to its trough, and returns to the baseline. This "up-down-back" motion is one cycle.
## Frequency

Frequency measures how many cycles a wave completes in one second. It is measured in Hertz (Hz).
## Wavelength

Wavelength is the physical distance between two consecutive points in the same phase of the wave (e.g., peak to peak or trough to trough).
## Amplitude

Amplitude represents the strength or intensity of a wave.
