## Ad Hoc Network

An ad hoc network is a simple, temporary, peer-to-peer network where devices connect directly to each other without any central infrastructure or access point.

Quick, temporary connections for file sharing, peer-to-peer gaming, or connecting devices when a router or access point isn’t available.

Devices communicate directly, forming a peer-to-peer network. Each device can act as both a client and a relay point, though typically there’s no dedicated routing. When Ad hoc wireless network is formed, they form what's called an **Independent Basic Service Set (IBSS)**.

## Infrastructure Mode

Infrastructure mode is the standard Wi-Fi setup, where all devices connect through a central access point, such as a router. The access point serves as a hub, managing traffic and connecting devices to each other and to external networks (like the internet). Devices connect to the central access point, which routes traffic between devices on the network and the internet.

**Common Use Cases:** Home Wi-Fi networks, office networks, public Wi-Fi hotspots.
## Mesh Network

A mesh network consists of multiple nodes that communicate with each tother to create a flexible, interconnected network. Each node extends the network range and provides redundant paths for data. Nodes connect to each other to form a mesh, with the primary (or “root”) node connected to the internet. Devices connect to the nearest mesh node, and data can hop from one node to another to reach its destination.

**Common Use Cases:** Large-scale networks, such as those for smart homes, city-wide public Wi-Fi, office buildings, or industrial sites.

## Point-to-Point (PtP) Wireless Network

A Point-to-Point network is a dedicated, direct wireless link established between two specific locations. It’s often used as a "wireless bridge" to connect two buildings or sites over a distance. Two devices (e.g., directional antennas) are pointed at each other to create a single, high-speed, low-latency link. Most PtP networks require line-of-sight between the two points.

**Common Use Cases:** Connecting two buildings, rural or remote network connections, temporary links for events or construction sites, and high-speed video surveillance connections.
