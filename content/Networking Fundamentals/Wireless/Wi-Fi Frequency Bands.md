## 2.4 GHz Band

- Range: 2.4–2.4835 GHz.
- Channels: Divided into 14 channels, each 20 MHz wide. However, only 1, 6, and 11 are typically used.
- Longer range: Can penetrate walls and obstacles better.
- Slower speed compared to 5 GHz due to narrower bandwidth.
- More interference: Shares the band with many other devices like Bluetooth, microwave ovens, and cordless phones.

## 5 GHz Band

- Range: 5.150–5.875 GHz (specific ranges depend on country regulations).
- Channels: Divided into 24 non-overlapping channels with widths of 20, 40, 80, or 160 MHz.
- Faster speeds: Supports higher data rates.
- Shorter range: Struggles to penetrate walls and obstacles.
- Less interference: Fewer competing devices compared to 2.4 GHz.

## 6 GHz Band (Wi-Fi 6E)

- Range: 5.925–7.125 GHz.
- Channels: Provides 59 non-overlapping channels with widths of 20, 40, 80, and 160 MHz.
- Ultra-fast speeds: Ideal for modern, high-throughput applications.
- Short range: Similar to 5 GHz, struggles with walls and obstacles.
- No legacy interference: Exclusively for Wi-Fi 6E devices.
