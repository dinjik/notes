## Guest Network Isolation

- Guest network isolation ensures that devices connected to a guest Wi-Fi network are restricted from accessing the main network and its resources (like printers, servers, or shared files).
- It creates a virtual separation between guest users and primary network users.

It is ideal for public spaces (e.g., coffee shops, hotels) where you want to offer internet access but protect internal resources.
## Wireless Client Isolation (Useful in Guest Networks)

- Wireless client isolation prevents devices connected to the same Wi-Fi network from communicating directly with one another.
- It isolates each client from others on the same network.

This is common in public Wi-Fi networks to prevent malicious users from accessing or attacking other clients (e.g., using packet sniffing or ARP spoofing).
## Captive Portals

- A captive portal is a web page that users are redirected to when they first connect to a Wi-Fi network.
- Itâ€™s typically used for authentication or presenting terms of use.

Captive portals are widely used in public Wi-Fi (e.g., hotels, airports, cafes) to authenticate users, collect information, or display ads.
