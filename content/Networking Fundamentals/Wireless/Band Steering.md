Band steering is a feature in modern Wi-Fi routers that helps devices connect to the most suitable Wi-Fi frequency band (e.g., 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz). It ensures optimal performance, reducing congestion and improving overall wireless experience.

### Decision Factors:

- **Device Capability:** Checks whether the device supports 5 GHz.
- **Signal Strength:** Chooses the band with the stronger signal for the device's current location.
- **Traffic Congestion:** Balances traffic by steering some devices to less congested bands.
- **Range Considerations:** Steers devices closer to the router to 5 GHz for higher speeds, while assigning 2.4 GHz to devices farther away.
