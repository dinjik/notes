Target Wake Time (TWT) is a power-saving feature in Wi-Fi 6 that allows devices to schedule specific times to wake up and communicate with the access point (AP). This reduces the amount of time devices need to be actively listening for network traffic, which significantly improves battery life, especially for IoT devices.
