- **Strong Passwords**: Ensure strong passwords are used for password-based authentication, or prefer public key authentication for better security.

- **Key Management**: Regularly rotate SSH keys and ensure that compromised or unused keys are removed from the server.

- **Limit Root Access**: Disallow root login via SSH to prevent unauthorized users from accessing critical system resources directly.

- **Use Firewalls**: Limit access to the SSH service through a firewall, only allowing trusted IP addresses to connect.

- **SSH Hardening**: Disable password authentication (if using public key authentication) and disable unused SSH features to reduce attack vectors.
