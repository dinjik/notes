DAS is the simplest form of data storage architecture. It’s basically storage (like a hard drive) connected directly to a server or a single computer. Think of it as an external hard drive plugged into your laptop through USB – it’s available only to the machine it’s directly connected to.

**Key Points of DAS:**

- Directly attached via SATA, SAS, or USB.
- Only accessible by the system it’s attached to, so it’s limited in scalability.
- Ideal for individual servers needing quick and local data access, such as in small offices.

**Performance and Limitations:**

- DAS is usually fast because there’s no network latency (the time it takes to send data across a network).
- As your storage needs grow, you have to add new storage to each machine individually, which doesn’t scale well.
