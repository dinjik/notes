EIGRP is a Cisco proprietary protocol that combines features of distance-vector and link-state protocols, offering faster convergence and better scalability.

EIGRP maintains routing tables and sends updates only when there's a change in the network, reducing unnecessary bandwidth usage. It uses the concept of "neighbor relationships," where routers exchange routing information with directly connected routers. These neighbors share routing updates with each other, ensuring that all routers in the network have consistent routing information.

**Components of EIGRP:**

1. **Hello Protocol:** Routers establish neighbor relationships using the hello protocol, which sends hello packets to neighboring routers. This helps the routers identify each other and decide if they should exchange routing information.

2. **DUAL Algorithm:** The DUAL algorithm ensures that EIGRP can quickly adapt to network changes, such as link failures, by recalculating the best path based on available routes.

3. **Update and Acknowledgment Packets:** EIGRP sends update packets to share new routing information, while acknowledgment packets confirm the receipt of updates.

4. **Reliable Transport Protocol (RTP):** EIGRP uses RTP to guarantee the reliable delivery of routing updates. It ensures that all packets reach their destination, even if there are network issues.
