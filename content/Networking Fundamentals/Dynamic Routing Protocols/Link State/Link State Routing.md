Link state routing protocols use a more dynamic and efficient method for routing compared to distance vector protocols. These protocols rely on each router sending information about its directly connected links to all other routers in the network. This information is then used to build a complete map of the network, allowing routers to independently compute the best route to each destination.

Link state protocols maintain a detailed map of the network's topology, which helps them calculate the shortest path to a destination using algorithms like Dijkstra’s algorithm.

### Key Features of Link State Routing Protocols

- **Complete Network Topology**: Each router in a link state protocol maintains a complete view of the network topology, unlike distance vector protocols, which only share routing tables with neighbors. This allows for more accurate and faster route calculation.

- **Flooding of Link State Advertisements (LSAs)**: Each router periodically sends Link State Advertisements (LSAs) to all other routers in the network, updating them about its directly connected links. This allows routers to keep track of the entire network’s current state.

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Once each router has the full network map, it uses Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest path to all destinations in the network.

- **Faster Convergence**: Link state protocols converge faster than distance vector protocols because they have complete and up-to-date information about the network. This reduces routing loops and minimizes downtime.
