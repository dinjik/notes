A **VPN (Virtual Private Network)** creates a secure, encrypted connection over a less secure network, such as the internet. It acts as a private tunnel through which data travels, keeping it protected from unauthorized access. This allows users and remote networks to communicate securely as if they were directly connected to a private network.

### **Key Benefits:**

- **Privacy** – Prevents third parties from intercepting or monitoring data.
- **Security** – Encrypts all transmitted data, ensuring confidentiality and integrity.
- **Remote Access** – Allows users to securely access a private network from anywhere in the world.
- **Bypassing Geo-restrictions** – Helps users access region-locked content by masking their actual IP address.

VPNs are commonly used by businesses for remote work, by individuals for online privacy, and by organizations for secure inter-office communication.
