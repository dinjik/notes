OpenVPN is a **client-based VPN** solution, meaning users must download and install the OpenVPN client on their device to connect to a VPN server. The client software handles the secure connection by using SSL/TLS for encryption, ensuring that the data being transmitted is protected.

- **TCP**: Offers reliable data transmission with error checking, retransmissions, and packet order maintenance. It’s ideal for applications where accuracy is critical, like file transfers or web browsing, but it tends to be slower due to the overhead involved in ensuring reliability.
- **UDP**: Provides faster data transmission but with no built-in error checking or retransmissions. It’s best suited for real-time applications like video streaming or VoIP, where speed is more important than guaranteed delivery.

### **Use Case**: 

OpenVPN is highly customizable and widely supported by many VPN providers. It is especially suited for **remote access VPNs** and **personal VPNs** due to its robust security features and flexibility in configuration. It’s an excellent choice for users who require strong security and network flexibility.
