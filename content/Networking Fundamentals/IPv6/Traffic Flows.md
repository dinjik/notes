## Unicast Addressing

A unicast address is used for one-to-one communication. A packet sent to a unicast address is delivered to a single specific device identified by that address.

**Key Characteristics:**

- Think of unicast as a direct phone call where you dial a specific number to reach a specific person.
- Used for most typical internet traffic, like web browsing or email.
- The IPv6 unicast address uniquely identifies one device.

## Multicast Addressing

A multicast address is used for one-to-many communication. A packet sent to a multicast address is delivered to all devices that are part of a specific multicast group.

**Key Characteristics:**

- Think of multicast as a conference call or a group email where everyone in the group receives the same message.
- Multicast is used for efficient group communication, like live streaming or distributing updates.
- IPv6 multicast addresses always begin with the prefix FF00::/8.

## Anycast Addressing

An anycast address is used for one-to-nearest communication. A packet sent to an anycast address is delivered to the closest device (in terms of network distance) among multiple devices that share the same anycast address.

**Key Characteristics:**

- Think of anycast as asking for help to multiple persons with the same name, and the nearest person responds.
- Typically used for load balancing and redundancy.
- Multiple devices can share the same anycast address, but the network determines which one is "nearest" to the sender.
