IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) is a protocol used by email clients to access and manage email messages on a mail server. Unlike POP3, which downloads messages and deletes them from the server, IMAP allows users to keep their emails on the server and synchronize email folders across multiple devices. IMAP is particularly useful for users who need to access their emails from different locations and devices while maintaining a consistent experience.

### Key Features of IMAP

- **Server-Side Storage**: IMAP allows emails to remain on the server, making it easier to access the same emails from different devices (e.g., desktop, laptop, smartphone) without duplicating messages.

- **Folder Management**: IMAP enables users to create, delete, and manage folders (or mailboxes) on the server. This allows users to organize their emails directly on the server, and the changes are synchronized across all devices.

- **Synchronization**: IMAP supports real-time synchronization of email folders, meaning any changes made on one device (e.g., reading or deleting an email) are reflected on all other devices connected to the same mail server.

- **Partial Downloading**: IMAP allows users to download only the headers of emails initially, with the ability to fetch the full content when needed. This minimizes bandwidth usage and improves performance, especially for users with large inboxes.

### IMAP Operations

- **User Authentication**: The email client connects to the mail server and authenticates the user using a username and password.

- **Message Retrieval**: IMAP retrieves messages from the server without downloading them permanently. The client can access all emails and folders directly from the server.

- **Message Deletion**: Emails are not deleted by default when read or moved. Users can delete emails manually, and the changes are synchronized across all devices.

- **Folder Synchronization**: IMAP syncs folder structures, such as inbox, sent items, drafts, etc., allowing users to organize emails and access them from any device.

### IMAP Command Set

- **LOGIN**: Used to authenticate the user with the server.
- **SELECT**: Selects a specific mailbox (folder) for the client to interact with.
- **FETCH**: Retrieves the email content from the server.
- **STORE**: Changes specific email attributes (such as marking an email as read or unread).
- **COPY**: Copies an email to another folder.
- **EXPUNGE**: Permanently removes emails marked for deletion.
- **LOGOUT**: Ends the session with the server.
