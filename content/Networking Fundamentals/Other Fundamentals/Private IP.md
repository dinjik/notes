Private IP addresses are reserved for internal network use and are not routable on the public internet. They allow multiple devices within a private network to communicate while using a single public IP for external access through NAT.

These IP ranges are widely used in homes, businesses, and enterprise networks to conserve public IP addresses.

#### **Why Use Private IP Addresses?**

- **Security**: Devices using private IPs cannot be directly accessed from the internet, reducing exposure to threats.
- **Address Conservation**: Private IPs help prevent IPv4 exhaustion by allowing multiple networks to reuse the same addresses.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Organizations do not need to purchase multiple public IPs for internal devices.
