### **Single VLAN Access Port**

A Single VLAN Access Port is configured to handle traffic from only one VLAN, for example, VLAN 300. Both data traffic (such as from computers) and voice traffic (such as from IP phones) share the same VLAN. This setup is useful in environments where software-based or third-party IP phones are in use, as it allows IP phones to mark packets for Quality of Service (QoS) using IEEE 802.1p. 802.1p leverages the 802.1q header to embed priority information, but it does not assign a VLAN ID (VID). In this configuration, the VLAN ID bits are set to 0 to indicate that the traffic is not part of a specific VLAN, but the QoS priority is still applied.

While this setup does not provide isolation between voice and data traffic for security purposes, it allows for QoS through 802.1p packet marking, ensuring that voice traffic receives higher priority over data traffic.

### **Multi-VLAN Access Port**

A Multi-VLAN Access Port supports two VLANs on the same port: one for data traffic (such as VLAN 300) and another for voice traffic (such as VLAN 400). This configuration is specifically designed for voice and data VLAN separation and does not support data-to-data VLAN setups. The IP phone uses Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) messages to identify its designated VLAN. This setup does not support LLDP-MED (Link Layer Discovery Protocol for Media Endpoint Devices), which is often used for device and VLAN discovery in other types of configurations.

A Multi-VLAN Access Port is ideal for deployments where Cisco IP phones are in use and there is a need to separate voice and data VLANs for better traffic management.
### **Trunk Port**

A Trunk Port is configured to support multiple VLANs, allowing traffic from several VLANs to traverse the same port. Both data VLAN (for example, VLAN 300) and voice VLAN (for example, VLAN 400) are explicitly tagged to identify the specific VLANs the traffic belongs to. Trunk ports are compatible with both Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) and LLDP-MED for device communication and VLAN discovery, which makes them versatile in handling various devices and ensuring proper traffic management across VLANs.

Trunk Ports are best suited for complex network environments where multiple VLANs are needed, and there is a requirement to segregate both data and voice traffic.
