IP Address Management (IPAM) is a method used to plan, manage, and track IP address allocations in a network. It involves the administration of IP address space, ensuring that IP addresses are assigned efficiently and that no conflicts occur. IPAM is essential in both large and small networks to maintain proper organization, prevent address collisions, and optimize address usage.

### **Key Functions of IPAM**

**IP Address Allocation**

- **Function:** IPAM systems automatically allocate IP addresses to devices on the network. This ensures that IP addresses are distributed efficiently and that devices can be assigned addresses without conflicts.
- **Example:** When a new device joins the network, IPAM determines the best available IP address to assign to it based on predefined rules and the current address pool.

**Subnetting and Addressing**

- **Function:** IPAM enables the creation and management of subnets within an IP address space. It allows network administrators to define smaller, logical groupings of IP addresses that can be assigned to different parts of the network, improving network efficiency and security.
- **Example:** A company might divide its address space into multiple subnets for different departments, ensuring that the IT department has a separate subnet from the finance department.

**DNS and DHCP Integration**

- **Function:** IPAM systems often integrate with Domain Name System (DNS) and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) services to streamline network management. By linking IP address assignments with DNS and DHCP, IPAM can provide real-time updates about which devices are using specific IP addresses.
- **Example:** When a new device is assigned an IP address, it is automatically registered in the DNS database, making it easier for users to access the device by its hostname instead of remembering its IP address.
