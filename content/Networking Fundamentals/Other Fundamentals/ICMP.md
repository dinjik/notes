ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) is a network layer protocol that plays a crucial role in diagnostics and error handling within an IP network. It is primarily used for sending error messages and operational information, helping devices identify issues with the network. ICMP is an integral part of the Internet Protocol (IP) suite and is typically used by network devices like routers and hosts to communicate status and error information back to the source of a packet.

### Key Features of ICMP

- **Error Reporting**: ICMP is used by routers and hosts to report issues with packet delivery, such as when a destination is unreachable or a packet's TTL (Time to Live) has expired.

- **Diagnostic Tool**: ICMP is commonly used in diagnostic tools like _ping_ and _traceroute_, which help network administrators test network connectivity and troubleshoot issues.

- **Control Messages**: ICMP also provides messages that inform hosts about network conditions, such as the need to fragment a packet or a destination being unreachable.

- **Protocol Type**: ICMP is classified as a network layer protocol in the OSI model and operates above the IP protocol.
