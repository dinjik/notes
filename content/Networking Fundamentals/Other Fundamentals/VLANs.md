A Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) is a logical group of devices within a network that are segmented into separate broadcast domains, even if they are physically located on the same network. VLANs allow for better traffic management, increased security, and the ability to separate different types of traffic, even on the same physical infrastructure.

## VLAN Types

**Default VLAN:**  
The default VLAN is typically VLAN 1, which all devices are initially a part of when connected to a network. It carries all untagged traffic and is used for initial device management.

**Data VLAN:**  
A data VLAN is used for general data traffic between end devices, such as computers or servers. Itâ€™s dedicated to a specific group of devices that communicate with each other regularly and are grouped based on their role or function.

**Voice VLAN:**  
Voice VLANs are dedicated to Voice over IP (VoIP) traffic, such as phone systems. These VLANs ensure that voice traffic receives the proper priority to maintain call quality, as voice traffic is sensitive to latency and packet loss.

**Management VLAN:**  
The management VLAN is used for network devices (like switches and routers) to be accessed for management purposes. Devices on this VLAN are typically isolated from regular user traffic and are used for network configuration and monitoring.

## VLAN Benefits

**Improved Security:**  
VLANs help increase security by isolating sensitive data traffic from other traffic. For instance, traffic on a voice VLAN is kept separate from regular data traffic, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or interference.

**Reduced Broadcast Traffic:**  
By segmenting a network into VLANs, broadcast traffic is limited to within each VLAN, reducing the overall traffic load on the network and improving performance.

**Simplified Network Management:**  
VLANs make it easier to manage and configure networks. Network administrators can create logical groups of devices, assign specific roles or permissions, and troubleshoot more efficiently without being restricted by physical locations.
