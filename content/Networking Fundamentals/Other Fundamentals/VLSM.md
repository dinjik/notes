VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Masking) is a technique used in IP networking to allow different subnet masks to be applied to different subnets within the same network. This allows for more efficient use of IP address space by creating subnets of varying sizes, depending on the number of hosts needed in each subnet. Unlike traditional subnetting, where all subnets are the same size, VLSM enables greater flexibility and more optimized IP address allocation.

### Key Features of VLSM

- **Flexibility**: VLSM allows for different subnet masks to be used within the same network, providing more efficient utilization of available IP addresses. Networks can be divided into smaller or larger subnets as needed, without wasting address space.

- **Efficient IP Address Utilization**: By using subnets with varying sizes, VLSM allows network administrators to allocate IP addresses based on the actual requirements of each subnet, reducing the number of unused addresses in the network.

- **Reduces Address Wastage**: With VLSM, networks that need only a few addresses can use a smaller subnet mask, while larger networks can use a subnet mask that accommodates more hosts. This minimizes wasted IP address space.

- **CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)**: VLSM is often used in conjunction with CIDR, which removes the class-based restrictions in traditional IP addressing and allows for more flexible subnetting.
