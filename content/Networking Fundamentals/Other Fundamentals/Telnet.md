Telnet is a network protocol that allows for remote communication with devices over a TCP/IP network. It operates at the Application Layer and provides a command-line interface (CLI) for communication, primarily used for remote login and managing network devices, servers, and other systems.

### Purpose

Telnet is used to provide a text-based interface to remote systems. It's commonly used for tasks such as system administration, managing network devices (routers, switches), and remote troubleshooting. Telnet has been largely replaced by more secure protocols, such as SSH (Secure Shell), due to its lack of encryption and susceptibility to security risks.

### Security Concerns

Since Telnet transmits data, including login credentials, in plaintext, it poses significant security risks. It is vulnerable to interception (e.g., through packet sniffing) and is not suitable for use in environments where security is a concern. Due to these vulnerabilities, Telnet has been largely replaced by SSH, which encrypts data to ensure secure communication.

### Example Use Case

Imagine an administrator needs to configure a network switch remotely:

1. The administrator opens a Telnet client and connects to the switchâ€™s IP address using port 23.
2. The administrator is prompted to enter a username and password.
3. After authentication, the administrator accesses the CLI of the switch, where they can configure settings such as VLANs, routing, and other network parameters.
4. Once the configuration is complete, the administrator logs out, closing the Telnet session.
