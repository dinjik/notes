Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in networking that refers to the process of wrapping data with the necessary protocol information at each layer of the OSI or TCP/IP model as it travels through the network. Encapsulation allows data to be transmitted securely and reliably between devices, ensuring that it reaches its destination in the correct format and order.

### Process of Encapsulation

As data moves down the layers of the OSI or TCP/IP model, it is encapsulated at each layer by adding specific headers and trailers to the original data. Here is a breakdown of how encapsulation works at each layer of the OSI and TCP/IP models:

**Application Layer**:

- The data generated by the application is referred to as **data**.

- It could be a message, a file, or any type of information that the application layer deals with.

**Transport Layer**:

- At this layer, the data is broken down into smaller chunks called **segments** (in TCP) or **datagrams** (in UDP).

- A **header** is added to each segment, which contains essential information such as source and destination ports, sequence numbers, and other control information needed to manage the communication between sender and receiver.

**Network Layer**:

- The data is further encapsulated into **packets** at the network layer.

- The **IP header** is added at this stage, containing important routing information such as source and destination IP addresses. This allows the data to be properly routed across different networks.

**Data Link Layer**:

- At the data link layer, the data is encapsulated into **frames**.

- A **frame header** is added, which contains MAC addresses, as well as any error-checking information, such as a Frame Check Sequence (FCS).

- The frame ensures that data can be transmitted over a physical medium (like Ethernet cables) and accurately delivered to the correct device within the local network.

**Physical Layer**:

- At the physical layer, the encapsulated frame is converted into a **bit stream** that is transmitted over the physical medium (e.g., electrical signals, light pulses).

- The physical layer ensures that the data is physically sent from one device to another.
