FLSM (Fixed Length Subnet Masking) is a subnetting method in which all subnets within a network use the same subnet mask. Unlike VLSM, where different subnets can have different sizes, FLSM uses a consistent subnet size for all subnets. This method is simple and easy to implement, making it suitable for networks that do not require highly flexible IP address allocation.

### Key Features of FLSM

- **Uniform Subnet Size**: All subnets in an FLSM network have the same size and subnet mask. This means that each subnet can accommodate the same number of hosts.

- **Simplicity**: Since all subnets are the same size, the process of creating and managing subnets is straightforward, with no need to calculate different subnet sizes for different parts of the network.

- **Easy to Implement**: FLSM is easy to implement and understand, especially in smaller networks where the needs for varying subnet sizes are not significant.

- **Less Address Wastage in Simple Networks**: FLSM ensures that address space is used efficiently when the number of subnets and hosts required is predictable and uniform.
