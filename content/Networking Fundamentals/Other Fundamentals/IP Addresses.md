An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique numerical identifier assigned to devices on a network that use the Internet Protocol for communication. IP addresses are used to identify devices in both private and public networks, allowing them to send and receive data. They ensure that data sent over the network reaches its intended destination.

### Key Types of IP Addresses

IP addresses come in two main versions:

- **IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4)**: The most widely used version of IP, consisting of 32 bits, typically represented in four decimal numbers separated by periods (e.g., 192.168.1.1).

- **IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6)**: A newer version of IP that uses 128 bits to provide a much larger address space. IPv6 addresses are represented as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).
