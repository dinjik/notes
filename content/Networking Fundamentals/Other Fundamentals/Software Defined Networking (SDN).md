Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is a modern network architecture that separates the control plane (the decision-making layer) from the data plane (the physical network responsible for forwarding traffic). This separation provides flexibility, centralization, and programmability in network management.

### **Core Components of SDN**

**Control Plane**

- **Function:** The control plane is responsible for making decisions about how traffic should flow throughout the network. It handles tasks like routing, traffic engineering, and enforcing policies across the entire network.
- **Key Role:** It centralizes the network's decision-making logic, which ensures consistency and optimization in network traffic flow. The control plane decides where and how data should be forwarded but doesnâ€™t directly perform the forwarding itself.
- **Example:** SDN controllers, such as ONOS and OpenDaylight, are responsible for programming the network devices to forward traffic based on specific policies or rules.

**Data Plane**

- **Function:** The data plane consists of physical or virtual devices, such as switches and routers, that forward network traffic according to the rules provided by the control plane.
- **Key Role:** The data plane acts as the "execution layer" where traffic forwarding happens. It does not make independent decisions but instead executes the forwarding instructions from the control plane.
- **Example:** OpenFlow-enabled switches implement flow rules sent from the SDN controller to manage how data is forwarded at the hardware level.

**Management Plane**

- **Function:** The management plane handles the configuration, monitoring, and maintenance of the network. It ensures that the network remains stable and operates efficiently.
- **Key Role:** It interfaces with the control plane to manage network devices and offers tools for administrators to configure and monitor the network's health. It can also interact with other systems such as orchestration platforms or policy engines.
- **Examples:** Monitoring network performance, such as traffic utilization and latency. Configuring network devices using REST APIs or CLI tools.
