Precision Time Protocol, defined in IEEE 1588, is designed for environments requiring **sub-microsecond accuracy**, such as industrial automation, telecommunications, and high-frequency trading.

#### **Key Features:**

• **Master-Slave Hierarchy** – A **Grandmaster Clock** serves as the reference, while slave devices synchronize with it. Intermediate **boundary clocks** may help distribute timing.  
• **Accuracy** – Provides sub-microsecond precision, far exceeding NTP.  
• **Hardware Assistance** – Uses specialized network hardware to timestamp packets at the hardware level, reducing jitter and latency.  
• **Synchronization Messages** – Involves sync messages from the master, follow-up corrections, and delay request/response exchanges to measure network delays.

#### **How PTP Works:**

1. **Sync Message** – The master sends a sync message with a timestamp.
2. **Delay Measurement** – The slave calculates the delay and time offset.
3. **Clock Adjustment** – The slave adjusts its clock to align with the master.
