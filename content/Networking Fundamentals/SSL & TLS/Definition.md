SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) are cryptographic protocols designed to provide secure communication over a computer network, particularly for web traffic. SSL was the original protocol, while TLS is its more secure and modern successor. Both protocols are used to encrypt data in transit, ensuring confidentiality, data integrity, and authentication between clients (e.g., web browsers) and servers.

### Key Features of SSL & TLS

- **Encryption**: Both SSL and TLS encrypt data exchanged between the client and server, making it unreadable to third parties who may attempt to intercept the communication.

- **Authentication**: SSL and TLS use certificates to authenticate the identity of the server, ensuring that the client is communicating with the intended entity.

- **Data Integrity**: These protocols ensure that the data has not been altered during transmission. If the data is modified, the recipient will detect the tampering.

### Differences Between SSL and TLS

- **SSL**: SSL was introduced in the 1990s and went through several versions (SSL 1.0, 2.0, 3.0). SSL 3.0 was widely used until it was found to have several vulnerabilities.

- **TLS**: TLS was introduced as an improvement over SSL. TLS 1.0 is based on SSL 3.0 but provides better security. TLS 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 further improved upon its predecessor with stronger encryption methods, better key exchange mechanisms, and other enhancements. TLS is now the standard for securing web traffic.
