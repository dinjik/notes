Before issuing commands, we should note that we can only issue the commands within the Windows Path. You can issue the command `set` to check your path from the command line.

```shell-session
C:\>set
ALLUSERSPROFILE=C:\ProgramData
[...]
LOGNAME=strategos
NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS=2
```
## ver
Letâ€™s use the `ver` command to determine the operating system (OS) version. The terminal below shows an example output.

```shell-session
C:\>ver                                                                                                                                              
Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.17763.1821]
