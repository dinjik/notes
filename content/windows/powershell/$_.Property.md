To filter services where the  contains the string "merry", you can use the  operator, combined with a wildcard (). Here's the corrected command:

```powershell
Get-Service | Where-Object { $_.DisplayName -like "*merry*" }
```

Think of it like this:

-  $_ = the whole object (one service at a time).
- $_.Property = a specific property of that object (like DisplayName ).

<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Without , PowerShell wouldn't know youâ€™re referring to the  property of each service in the pipeline.</mark>
