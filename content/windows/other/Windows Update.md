Windows Update is a service provided by Microsoft to provide security updates, feature enhancements, and patches for the Windows operating system and other Microsoft products, such as Microsoft Defender.

Updates are typically released on the 2nd Tuesday of each month. This day is called **Patch Tuesday**. That doesn't necessarily mean that a critical update/patch has to wait for the next Patch Tuesday to be released. If the update is urgent, then Microsoft will push the update via the Windows Update service to the Windows devices.

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;"> Another way to access Windows Update is from the Run dialog box, or CMD, by running the command</mark> `control /name Microsoft.WindowsUpdate`.
