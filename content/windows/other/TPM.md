**The Trusted Platform Module** (TPM) is a hardware-based security feature that’s either built into your computer’s motherboard or integrated into its processor. Its primary purpose is to provide a secure environment for storing and managing cryptographic keys, passwords, and other sensitive data. <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">It ensures the integrity of your system by verifying that your operating system and firmware have not been tampered with.</mark>

TPM enables several critical security features, such as:

<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">For Windows 11, having TPM 2.0 is a minimum requirement, as it helps enhance system security by protecting against malware and unauthorized access. </mark>

- **BitLocker encryption**: Protects your data by encrypting your drives and unlocking them only when the TPM confirms the system’s integrity.
- **Windows Hello**: Supports secure biometric authentication, like facial recognition and fingerprints, by safely storing authentication data.
- **Secure Boot**: Works with the TPM to ensure only trusted software runs during your system’s startup.
