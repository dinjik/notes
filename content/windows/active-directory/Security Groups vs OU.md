While both are used to classify users and computers, their purposes are entirely different:

- **OUs** are handy <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">forÂ applying policies to users and computers, which include specific configurations that pertain to sets of users depending on their particular role in the enterprise</mark>. Remember, a user can only be a member of a single OU at a time, as it wouldn't make sense to try to apply two different sets of policies to a single user.

- **Security Groups**, on the other hand, are <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">used to grant permissions over resources</mark>. For example, you will use groups if you want to allow some users to access a shared folder or network printer. A user can be a part of many groups, which is needed to grant access to multiple resources.
