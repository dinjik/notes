GPOs are distributed to the network via a network share called `SYSVOL`, which is stored in the DC. All users in a domain should typically have access to this share over the network to sync their GPOs periodically. The SYSVOL share points by default to the `C:\Windows\SYSVOL\sysvol\` directory on each of the DCs in our network.

Once a change has been made to any GPOs, it might take up to 2 hours for computers to catch up. If you want to force any particular computer to sync its GPOs immediately, you can always run the following command on the desired computer:

```shell-session
PS C:\> gpupdate /force
```
