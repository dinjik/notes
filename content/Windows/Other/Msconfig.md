**Msconfig** (System Configuration) is a tool in Windows that allows users to manage startup processes, services, and boot options. It helps troubleshoot performance issues, disable unnecessary services, and customize the way Windows boots.

## How Msconfig Works

Msconfig provides options to control which programs and services run at startup. It can also configure boot settings to improve system performance or diagnose issues.

- Modifies **startup settings** to speed up boot time
- Disables unnecessary **services** to free up system resources
- Provides **safe boot** options for troubleshooting

## Msconfig Sections

Msconfig has several tabs that allow users to configure different aspects of system behavior.

|Tab|Description|
|---|---|
|General|Choose **Normal Startup**, **Selective Startup**, or **Diagnostic Startup**|
|Boot|Configure boot options like **Safe Boot** and **Boot Log**|
|Services|Enable or disable specific system services|
|Startup|Manage startup programs (in Windows 7 or earlier)|
|Tools|Access various **Windows diagnostic tools**|
