**Resmon** (Resource Monitor) is a tool in Windows that provides real-time data about your system's performance. It shows detailed information on CPU, memory, disk, and network usage, helping diagnose performance issues.

## How Resmon Works

Resmon collects data about your systemâ€™s resources and organizes it into tabs. It helps monitor and manage system performance by showing which processes and services are using system resources.

- Monitors **CPU**, **memory**, **disk**, and **network** usage
- Helps identify performance **bottlenecks** or resource hogs
- Provides detailed process-level data for troubleshooting

## Key Sections in Resmon

Resmon organizes its information into several key tabs.

|Tab|Description|
|---|---|
|**Overview**|Displays a summary of resource usage (CPU, Memory, Disk, Network)|
|**CPU**|Shows detailed CPU usage by process, threads, and services|
|**Memory**|Displays memory usage, including processes using the most RAM|
|**Disk**|Provides information on disk activity and processes using disk resources|
|**Network**|Shows network activity, including data usage by processes|

1. Press **Windows + R**
2. Type `resmon` and hit **Enter**

### Common Tasks

- **Monitor CPU Usage**  
    The **CPU** tab shows real-time CPU usage and breaks it down by processes, services, and threads. You can identify which processes are consuming CPU resources.

    ```plaintext
    Example: Process "chrome.exe" using 20% CPU
    ```

- **Track Memory Usage**  
    The **Memory** tab displays how much RAM is being used by each process, making it easy to spot high memory usage.

    ```plaintext
    Example: "taskmgr.exe" using 1 GB of RAM
    ```

- **Check Disk Activity**  
    The **Disk** tab shows which processes are using your disk and how much data is being read or written. This helps identify disk-intensive tasks.

    ```plaintext
    Example: "msedge.exe" reading 300 MB from the disk
    ```

- **Monitor Network Activity**  
    The **Network** tab tracks network data usage and shows which processes are using the network, such as downloading or uploading files.
