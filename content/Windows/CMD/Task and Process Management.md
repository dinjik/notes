In Command Prompt (CMD), `tasklist` and `taskkill` are essential commands for managing processes on a Windows system. They allow users to monitor, troubleshoot, and terminate processes, which can be useful for improving system performance or resolving issues with unresponsive applications.

## `tasklist` Command

The `tasklist` command provides a list of all currently running processes, showing important information such as process IDs (PIDs), memory usage, and the status of each process. This command is commonly used for monitoring system activity and identifying processes that may be consuming excessive resources.

### Basic Usage

To display a list of all running processes:

```cmd
tasklist
```

This command will show a table of processes, including their names, PIDs, session names, and memory usage.

### Filtering Output with `tasklist`

The `tasklist` command also supports filters to help narrow down the results.

- **Filter by Process Name:** To display processes of a specific name, use the `/fi` switch:

    ```cmd
    tasklist /fi "imagename eq notepad.exe"
    ```

    This will show only the processes with the name `notepad.exe`.

- **Display with Verbose Output:** The `/v` switch adds more detailed information, such as the status and the window title for GUI-based processes:

    ```cmd
    tasklist /v
    ```

- **Show Specific Process Information:** You can filter based on the PID or session name using `/fi` with specific criteria. For example:
    
    ```cmd
    tasklist /fi "pid eq 1234"
    ```
    
    This will show information about the process with the PID of `1234`.
    

### Example of `tasklist` Output

```cmd
Image Name                     PID Session Name     Session#    Mem Usage
========================= ======== ================ =========== ============
explorer.exe                   1056 Console                    1   20,000 K
notepad.exe                    1248 Console                    1    5,000 K
```

This shows the process name, PID, memory usage, and other details.

## `taskkill` Command

The `taskkill` command is used to terminate a running process by specifying either its process ID (PID) or image name. It is helpful when a process becomes unresponsive and needs to be forcefully terminated.

### Basic Usage

To terminate a process using its PID:

```cmd
taskkill /PID 1234
```

Replace `1234` with the actual PID of the process you wish to terminate.

### Terminate a Process by Name

You can also kill processes by their image name:

```cmd
taskkill /IM notepad.exe
```

This will terminate all instances of `notepad.exe` running on the system.

### Forcefully Terminate a Process

The `/f` option forces the termination of a process, even if it's not responding. This is useful for unresponsive programs that can't be closed normally.

```cmd
taskkill /f /IM notepad.exe
```

This will forcefully terminate all instances of `notepad.exe`.

### Terminate a Process and Its Child Processes

The `/t` switch allows you to terminate the specified process and all its child processes. This is useful when a parent process spawns additional background tasks.

```cmd
taskkill /f /IM notepad.exe /t
```

This will forcefully kill `notepad.exe` and any processes that were launched by it.

### Example of `taskkill` Usage

To terminate a specific process with the PID `5678`:

```cmd
taskkill /PID 5678
```

To forcefully terminate `chrome.exe`:

```cmd
taskkill /f /IM chrome.exe
```
